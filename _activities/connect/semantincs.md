# Code Semantics

- Time: 5-10 minutes

Ask a member of the ensemble to help you with a example. Tell them you are going to ask them to remember, and repeat back to you a sequence.
Ask them to repeat the sequence as quickly as they like after you finish speaking.

Read the following numbers, split into 3 then 4 digits. Read the list briskly but clearly:

### A list of 7 Numbers

5,1,7

6,4,8,2

Hopefully your volunteer will be comfortable replaying these 7 digits back to you. Ask the team to agree that a list of 7 numbers can be held in short term memory for some time. Do the team agree that these numbers would be much harder to remember come the end of the learning hour?

### A list of 7 Unrelated Words
Now tell your volunteer that you would like them to do the excerise again. Ask them if they are ready, and then read the following list of words.
Read the list as lists of 3 then 4, briskly as before, but also clearly.

Car, Toothbrush, Notebook

Teddy-Bear, Microphone, Fish, Radio

Congratulate the volunteer if they are able to recall the list correctly, and then ask how they felt the second time around.
The volunteer may be prepared to agree that they felt some small amount of stress or conflict at the effort required.

### A list of 7 related words in a familar sequence
Thank the volunteer and ask if they can participate a final time. When they are ready read the final list, briskly but clearly, the same as in other excercises.

Bread,
Butter,
Ham

Cheese,
Lettuce,
Tomato,
Pickle

Congratulate the volunteer if they are able to recall the list correctly, and then ask how they felt repeating the list this time around. Hopefully the whole ensemble will be able to agree that this list was much less stressful

### Review

Which list was easiest to remember? Rank them 1 being easiest, 3 being hardest.

Why is the list of unrelated numbers easier that the list of unrelated words?

Which list would the team feel most confident about being able to recall, at the end of the session? What reasons would they give?

## Benefits
This exercise allows us to introduce code complexity in terms of semantics. Complicated code can be made more accessible and memorable if it makes sense in terms of a narrative.

Even simple code can be difficult to work with if the behaviour doesn't fit a narrative.

When we have to work with code that doesn't conform to a narrative we're likely to feel more uncomfortable.

You can then move on to introduce concepts such as 
Single Responsibility, Extract Function, Extract Class or other Clean Code concepts
